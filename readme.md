__🏗 This aplication is still under development. But almost complete 🏗__

<br />

# App Info 🔤

__This application 🍰 belongs to a collection of other other apps which work hand in hand to create a great e-commerce application 🎂.__

> ## App division 
> 1. **Clients** webapp to browse and order products
> 2. **Administrators** webapp to get all client orders
> 3. **RESTfull API** to connect both **webapps** <br>

**I am planning on building 🧱 a mobile app so clients can order on their smarphones 📱 aswell. I'll be using ReactNative.**

<br />

# Admins (__Dashboard__) Webpage ℹ️

**This piece 🍕 of the application is the one which admins will have access to.**

>- On **PRODUCTS** Create, Update, List and delete 🍡

❗ **OBS** Unfortunatley you wont have access to the website because you aint an admin user ❗

> ## Built With ⚒ ?
> **I went a little bit old fashion while building this app, but used some pretty new and cool web technologies.**
> 1. **Pug** (HTML)
> 2. **SASS** (CSS)
> 3. **Typescript** (Javascript) <br >   
><p>I've built a few <b>applications</b> already using this same approch, using <b>pug</b>, <b>SASS</b> and <b>TypeScript</b>. using webpack to compile everthing.</p>
> <p>  On their webapp I build for the clients, I used alot of similer <b>funciton</b>. So I plan on building a basic <b>framework</b>. For this kind of application.</p>
